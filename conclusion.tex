\section{Concluding remarks}\label{sc:summary}
This work used a topological ordering based on the interconnected FMUs variable and internal FMU variable connections along with predicates from the FMI specification to calculate a correct initialization order for a co-simulation. This approach can be combined with an arbitrary master algorithm. 
The approach was realized as a plugin for the open-source INTO-CPS Maestro 2 tool and verified against the existing \textit{Initializer}.
Future work includes formally verifying the plugin, and its implementation of the algorithm used to calculate the topological ordering using the Logika framework.
